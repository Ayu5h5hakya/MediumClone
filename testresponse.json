In 2040, its co-founder, the late James Anorak Halliday announces a contest via a posthumous recording, in which players must find an Easter egg inside a gate that requires three keys hidden in the worlds; the winner will receive full ownership and control of the OASIS. This attracts a number of Gunters (egg hunters) as well as the video game conglomerate Innovative Online Industries (IOI), headed by their new CEO Nolan Sorrento, who employs researchers of Halliday, as well as top gamers and indentured servants called Sixers",

Sorrento requests Wade to join IOI, but when he refuses out of distrust, Sorrento and his aide F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice and Wade's neighbors. Wade is taken to a Gunter hideout where he meets Art3mis in reality: Samantha Cook. They discover that Halliday regretted a movie date with a woman named Kira, who later married Morrow. After Parzival wins a coin on a small bet with the archive's curator, the High Five enter a re-creation of The Shining where they traverse a series of frightening events to eventually reach Kira to acquire the second key.",
